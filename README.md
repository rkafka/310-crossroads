# 310-crossroads
Semester Project for CSCE-310 course in Spring 2023 semester.

This is **Ryan Kafka**'s version. Integration issues have crippled the cohesion of the project and broken functionalities of various components. 
*We apologize.* However, we do want to show that the functionality is completed, and specifically that I have done my part. I do not want to be
seen as having neglected my work or built an insufficient attempt since the integration efforts were haphazard.

I. Setting up frontend
  1. Copy "frontend_crossroads" folder into C:\xampp\htdocs\

II. Setting up backend
  1. Import "crossroads.sql" on base screen of phpMyAdmin

III. Item Information
- All items and item_list functionality should be located within the admin_acc and customer_acc folder. Admin_acc contains code to get to the admin's home page and have 4 database functionalities: View, update, insert, and delete. For Customer_acc folder, you can access 4 functionalities: search, update, insert, and delete.
