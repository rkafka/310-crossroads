# 310-crossroads
Semester Project for CSCE-310 course in Spring 2023 semester.

This is **Ryan Kafka**'s version. Integration issues have crippled the cohesion of the project and broken functionalities of various components. 
*We apologize.* However, we do want to show that the functionality is completed, and specifically that I have done my part. I do not want to be
seen as having neglected my work or built an insufficient attempt since the integration efforts were haphazard.

I. Setting up frontend
  1. Copy full "crossroads" folder into C:\xampp\htdocs\

II. Setting up backend
  1. Import "crossroads.sql" on base screen of phpMyAdmin

To use this app, please start by starting your php server and navigating to http://localhost/crossroads/login.php
